#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of computer science, engineering and software management principles to design, develop, maintain, test and evaluate software systems. Such systems incorporate technology through coding, building apps, gaming features and websites to solve real-world problems and enhance the user experience. 
Software engineering is essential in the technology industry as it ensures that the developed systems are of high quality and reliability; are scalable and perform optimally; are cost-efficient, and are compliant with security and regulatory requirements.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The introduction of structured programming in the 1960s and 1970s - This led to the use of clear, hierarchical structures in code, thus enhancing readability and maintainability.
2. The emergence of software engineering as a profession in the early 1980s - Software engineering began to be recognized as a distinct profession, standing alongside computer science and traditional engineering disciplines.
3. Adoption of agile methodologies in the early 2000s - This approach transformed software development by promoting iterative progress, collaboration and flexibility. This revolutionized the project management aspect of software engineering.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning - This step involves identifying objectives, scope, resources, and timelines for the project.
2. Requirement analysis - This phase incorporates the gathering and documentation of functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders. This includes conducting feasibility studies to assess the technical and financial viability of the project.
3. Design - This stage involves the creation of the architecture and design components of the software, including user interfaces and database structures.
4. Implementation - This is the translation of design documents into executable code using apt programming languages and tools, adhering to coding standards and guidelines.
5. Testing - The performance of various tests such as unit, integration, system and acceptance testing to identify and fix defects. This ensures that the product meets quality standards.
6. Deployment - This phase involves the release of the software into the production environment, making it accessible to the end-users. This stage may involve installation, configuration and user training.
7. Maintenance - This is the ongoing support and updates aimed at addressing issues, implementing enhancements and improving functionality.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is the traditional, linear approach towards software development. Each phase has to be completed before proceeding to the next phase. In this approach, the requirements are gathered at the initial stages of development and are expected to remain unchanged. This approach emphasizes documentation at each stage making it easy to manage the project. The Waterfall methodology applies to projects with well-defined requirements, strict regulatory and compliance needs, and large-scale systems that require robust documentation. An example of a scenario where the Waterfall methodology would be appropriate is in the design of a fighter jet software for the military.
In contrast, the Agile methodology is the iterative and flexible approach that promotes collaboration and customer feedback. Rather than having a linear approach towards software development, this methodology divides development into small units called sprints that typically last 2-4 weeks. Each sprint involves planning, development, testing, review and retrospective stages. This cycle repeats, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements. The Agile methodology is ideal for projects with evolving requirements where user feedback and rapid iteration are crucial for success. An example of a scenario where the Agile methodology would be appropriate is in the development of an analysis app for use in forex trading.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software Developer is responsible for the design, coding and implementation of software applications based on project requirements. They are involved in requirement analysis, design and development, testing and debugging, documentation of code and development processes, and handling maintenance and software updates. Software Developers are the builders who turn ideas and designs into functional software.
Quality Assurance Engineers focus on the quality and functionality of the software through systematic testing and process improvements. They are responsible for test planning, test case design and execution, automation of testing scripts, bug tracking and reporting, and process improvement. They are the gatekeepers of quality.
Project Managers oversee the planning, execution and completion of software projects while aligning with business objectives and efficient resource utilization. Their responsibilities include progress monitoring, team coordination, project planning, and quality assurance oversight. Project Managers are the orchestrators of the project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a comprehensive software suite that consolidates essential development tools into a unified interface, streamlining the coding process. Its key features include a code editor, compiler/interpreter, debugger, build automation tools, and version control integration. IDEs enhance productivity and streamline coding, debugging and workflow. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code and Eclipse.
VCS are tools designed to track and manage changes in code over time, enabling multiple developers to collaborate effectively. Their importance lies in change tracking, collaboration, branching and merging, and backup and recovery. Examples of VCS include Git and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges faced by software engineers include keeping up with rapid technological changes, managing complex project requirements, meeting tight deadlines, maintaining work-life balance, and security concerns.
The strategies to overcome these challenges include:
1. To keep up with rapidly changing technologies, the developer should maintain a commitment to continuous learning and community engagement to aid in knowledge sharing and the developer's being up-to-date.
2. Managing complex project requirements would require detailed and clear documentation of the requirements, and regular communication with the stakeholders to manage expectations and clarify requirements.
3. Realisting planning through the setting of achievable deadlines and prioritization of critical features would help in meeting tight deadlines.
4. The setting of clear work hours, regular break periods and delegation to distribute workloads evenly would aid in maintaining the work-life balance.
5. Security concerns can be mitigated by implementing best security practices, conducting regular security audits and staying updated on emerging threats.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing focuses on individual components of the software such as functions. This ensures the correct working of the components in isolation. Unit testing enables easy debugging, early capture of errors, and correct unit performance before integration into a larger system.
2. Integration testing targets the interaction between the integrated units to ensure that they work together as expected. This helps in identifying issues in component interaction, the correct functioning of the integrated units as a whole, and in verifying that data is correctly passed between modules.
3. System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly in the intended environment. This validates the complete software applications and identifies discrepancies between the actual and expected behaviour of the system.
4. Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether the software is ready for delivery. It is often conducted by end-users or clients. This confirms that the software is fit for purpose and ready for production or release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of formulating precise and clear instructions as inputs to effectively guide AI models in generating accurate, relevant, and high-quality outputs.
A good prompt leads to improved response quality, maximized AI capabilities, enhanced user experience and facilitating specific use cases. By mastering prompt engineering, users can unlock the full potential of AI models and ensure that users receive the most accurate, relevant and helpful responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt: "What is the weather?"
This prompt is broad and lacks direction, which can lead to generic responses. To improve the clarity, specificity and conciseness of the prompt, we can include the location and timeframe specifications.
Improved prompt: "What is the current weather in Nairobi, Kenya?"
